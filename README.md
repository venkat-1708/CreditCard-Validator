# CreditCard-Validator
In this digital world where e-commerce is ruling, credit cards are a must-have. Most payment gateways utilize some kind of validation mechanism for credit card data before they proceed with the payment. What if there exists a software to accomplish this validation from the get-go? The validation operates differently for different cards, so deciding what type of card it is and then inspecting if the number entered is a valid credit card number or not is the way to go. Used Luhn's Algorithm to validate a Credit Card Number.
